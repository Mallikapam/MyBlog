    <p> Hi Barbies! My name is Mallika and this is the start of my blog. <em>word.</em> </p>
    <p>Yes, I do know this is very mom core, but it is also very cute and, <em>unfortunately</em>, very code intensive. 
    just kidding coding gods who are looking at this, <u> whoever may you be.</u> I am using this as a funny little creative way to talk about my 
    life and I hope you guys can tell that I just recently watched the Barbie movie. I hope you all also watched the barbie movie because I will
    irrevocably never be the same ever again. It truly reminded me of every woman I've ever loved in my life in such a beautiful way. It reminded
    me to keep my female friendships. Every single one of them are so important in my life. </p>
